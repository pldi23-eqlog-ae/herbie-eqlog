    <h1>Herbie 1.5 Release Notes</h1>
  </header>

  <p>The <a href="../..">Herbie</a> developers are excited to announce
  Herbie 1.5! This release focuses on multiple precisions, new syntax,
  and higher accuracy. Our favorite features are below.</p>

  <p><b>What is Herbie?</b> Herbie automatically improves the accuracy
  of floating point expressions. This avoids the bugs, errors, and
  surprises that so often occur with floating point arithmetic.</p>

  <p><b>Join us!</b> Join the Herbie developers on the
  <a href="https://fpbench.org">FPBench</a> Slack, at the monthly
  FPBench community meetings, and at
  <a href="https://fpbench.org/talks/fptalks21.html">FPTalks 2021</a>,
  where <a href="https://bsaiki.com">Brett</a> will be talking about
  Herbie 1.5.</p>

  <h2>New Pareto mode</h2>

  <p>Traditionally, Herbie has been all about giving you the most
  accurate way possible to evaluate some mathematical expression.
  But many of our users need to balance accuracy with speed.</p>
  
  <p>So Herbie 1.5 has an experimental new <a>pareto mode</a>. When
  the pareto mode is turned on, Herbie produces multiple outputs
  that trade off speed for accuracy. Run Herbie with <kbd>--pareto</kbd>
  to try it out, and if you're interested in more details of how it works,
  check out our paper at <a href="../../arith21.html">ARITH'21</a>.</p>

      \end{array}
      \)
    </div>

  <h2>Symmetric expressions</h2>

  <p>We've been working hard improving Herbie's results on its
  traditional task: finding the most accurate way to evaluate
  a mathematical expression. In Herbie 1.5, several improvements
  landed, but the most exciting is the symmetric expressions mode.</p>

  <p>Simply put, it's pretty common for Herbie to be asked to
  improve the accuracy of an expression where reordering the variables
  leaves the expression unchanged&mdash;something like
  <code>log(exp(x) + exp(y))</code>.
  Often the best way to evaluate that expression requires determining
  which of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> is larger.</p>

  <p>With symmetric expressions, Herbie can detect when variable order
  doesn't matter and sort the variables up front. That often lets
  Herbie's other components find a clever way to improve accuracy.</p>

  <figure class="showcase">
    <pre>
(FPCore dist2 (x y)
  (+ (* x x) (* y y)))

(FPCore (x y)
  (/ (sqrt (+ (dist2 x y) x)) (sqrt 2)))
    </pre>
    <figcaption>Using a function definition in FPCore. The first
    FPCore block defines the <code>dist2</code> function, and the
    second uses that definition. The result is shorter and more
    readable.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <h2>Function definitions</h2>

  <p>While most people use Herbie via the web interface,
  Herbie also supports the standard <a href="input.html">FPCore</a>
  format. FPCore offers more control over Herbie, and it's also
  a good output format for other tools. In this release, we extended
  Herbie to support function definitions.</p>

  <p>In short, an FPCore can now include a function name between
  the <code>FPCore</code> keyword and the list of variables. That core
  can then be referenced by other cores in the same file. Herbie will
  automatically expand those calls before improving the expression.</p>

  <h2>Other improvements</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Herbie now supports more pluggable number representations,
    including arbitrary-precision floating-point numbers and also
    fixed-point numbers. We're still working on better-exposing this
    to users.</li>
    <li>Herbie will now introduce some temporary variables to make its
    output more readable.</li>
    <li>The series expansion engine was substantially improved, which
    both reduces timeouts and improves results substantially.</li>
    <li>A new "retirement community" data structure allows Herbie to
    consider more candidate programs, and thus produces better,
    simpler results.</li>
    <li>You can now give Herbie FPCore input in the web interface.</li>
    <li>The Herbie timeline data structure (which powers "Metrics"
    pages) has been dramatically improved, making it easier to add
    more metrics in the future.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Deprecations and removals</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Support for the Racket 7-series is deprecated and will be
    removed in the next release. Please upgrade.</li>
    <li>The <code>egg-herbie</code> support package has been merged
    into Herbie proper. This means that if you want to install Herbie
    from source, you will now need a Rust compiler.</li>
    <li>Support for complex numbers has been deprecated and will be
    removed in the next release.
    Please <a href="mailto:herbie@cs.washington.edu">let us know</a>
    if you are using it. We hope to reimplement this eventually,
    but with a better architecture.</li>
    <li>The <kbd>precision:double</kbd> flag has been deprecated, and no
    longer does anything. Use the <code>:precision</code> flag instead.</li>
    <li>The <kbd>setup:early-exit</kbd> flag has been deprecated, and no
    longer does anything. Herbie is fast enough now that it's not that
    important any more!</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Try it out!</h2>

  <p>
    We want Herbie to be more useful to scientists, engineers, and
    programmers around the world. We've got a lot of features we're
    excited to work on in the coming months. Please
