  <h1>The Herbie report</h1>

  <p>When used <a href="using-web.html">in the browser</a>, Herbie
  generates HTML reports full of information about the accuracy of
  your input and its output expressions.</p>

  <h2 id="summary">Summary numbers</h2>

  <p>First, a brief summary of the results. For most uses, the
    “Average Error” number, which describes how accurate the input and
    output expressions are, is the most important statistic in this
    section. The other numbers list time Herbie took to improve the
    program and the <a href="input.html#precisions">precision</a>
    assumed for floating-point operations.
  </p>

    precision refers to double-precision IEEE-754
    arithmetic.</figcaption>

  <h2 id="programs">Input and output programs</h2>

  <p>Second, the input and output programs themselves, in standard
  mathematical syntax. In the top-right corner, the drop-down can be
  used to switch to C syntax or some other format.</p>

    <img width="100%" src="report-prog.png" />

  </figure>

  <h2 id="graph">Error graph</h2>

  <p>
    Third, under <em>Error</em>, a graph of floating-point error
    versus input value. This is helpful for understanding the sorts of
    inputs Herbie is improving accuracy on. Sometimes, Herbie improved
    accuracy on some inputs at the cost of accuracy on other inputs
    that you care more about. You can add
    a <a href="input.html#preconditions">precondition</a> to restrict
    Herbie to certain inputs in those cases.
  </p>

  <p>
    These graphs show the error of the input program with a red line,
    and the error of the output program with a blue line. Both can be
    toggled. If the expression has multiple variables, the variable
    picker on the bottom left selects which variable is placed on the
    horizontal axis. If Herbie decided to insert an <code>if</code>
    statement into the program, the locations of those <code>if</code>
    statements will be marked with vertical bars.
  </p>

    selector (<code>x</code> is selected) and the toggles for the
    input and output program (both are toggled on).</figcaption>

  <h2 id="try-it">Interactive inputs</h2>

  <p>
    Fourth, a interactive form where you can the output of both your
    and Herbie's programs. on inputs of your choice Enter argument
    values on the left, and the input and output programs will be
    evaluated on those arguments and the results printed on the right.
  </p>

  <figure>

      "Out" is Herbie's.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <h2 id="derivation">Derivation</h2>

  <p>Fifth, Herbie's derivation of its output program. These can be
    helpful in understanding how Herbie works. Each substantive step
    in the derivation also lists the error, in bits, of that step's
    output. Sometimes you can use that to pick a less-complex and
    not-substantially-less-accurate program.</p>

  <p>Derivations sometime name arithmetic laws used by Herbie, or they
    might claim derivation steps are done by simplification, series
    expansion, or other Herbie strategies. The derivation will also
    call out any time the input is split into cases. When one part of
    the program is colored blue, that is the part modified in that
    derivation step.
  </p>

  <h2 id="reproduction">Reproduction</h2>

  <p>Sixth, a command to reproduce this Herbie result. If you find a
  Herbie bug, include this code snippet when
  <a href="https://github.com/uwplse/herbie/issues">filing an
  issue</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="links">Additional links</h2>
  
  <p>The top of the page has a right-hand menu bar with additional
  links. “Report” returns you to Herbie's main page. “Log” and
  “Metrics” give you detailed internal information about Herbie.</p>

  <p>We expect the report to grow more informative with future
  versions. Please <a href="mailto:herbie@cs.washington.edu">get in
  touch</a> if there is more information you'd like to see.</p>
