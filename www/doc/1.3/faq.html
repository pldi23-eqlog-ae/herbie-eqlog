  <p><a href="../../">Herbie</a> automatically transforms floating
  point expressions into more accurate forms. This page troubleshoots
  common Herbie errors.</p>


  <h2>Common errors</h2>

  <p>
    Herbie error messages refer here for additional information and
    debugging tips.
  </p>

  <h3 id="invalid-syntax">Invalid syntax</h3>

  <p>
    This error means you mis-formatted Herbie's input. Common errors
    include misspelled function names and parenthesized expressions
    that should not be parenthesized. For example, in
    <code>(- (exp (x)) 1)</code>, the expression <code>x</code> is a
    variable so shouldn't be parenthesized. <code>(- (exp x) 1)</code>
    would be the correct way of writing that expression. Please review
    the <a href="input.html">input format</a> documentation for more.
  </p>

  <h3 id="sample-valid-points">Cannot sample enough valid points</h3>

  <p>This error occurs when Herbie is unable to find enough valid
  points. For example, the expression <code>(acos (+ 1000 x))</code>
  only yields a valid result when <code>x</code> is between -1001 and
  -999, a rather narrow range. The solution is to help out Herbie by
  specifying a precondition: <code>:pre (&lt; -1001 x -999)</code>.
  Herbie will use the precondition to improve its sampling strategy.
  </p>

  <h3 id="no-valid-values">No valid values</h3>

  <p>This error indicates that your precondition excludes all possible
  inputs. For example, the precondition <code>(&lt 3 x 2)</code>
  excludes all inputs. Herbie raises this exception when it can prove
  that no inputs could work. The solution is to fix the precondition
  to allow some inputs.</p>

  <h3 id="mpfr-prec-limit">Exceeded MPFR precision limit</h3>

  <p>This rare error indicates that Herbie could not compute a "ground
  truth" for your expression. For some expressions, like <code>(sin
  (exp x))</code>, calculating a correct output for large input values
  requires exponentially many bits. Herbie raises this error when more
  than 10,000 bits are required.</p>


  <h2>Common warnings</h2>

  <p>Herbie warnings refer here for explanations and common actions to
  take.</p>

  <h3 id="ground-truth">Could not determine a ground truth</h3>

  <p>
    Herbie will raise this warning when some inputs require more than
    10Â 000 bits to compute an exact ground truth value. For example,
    to compute <code>(/ (exp x) (exp x))</code> for very
    large <code>x</code>, absurdly large exponents would be required.
    Herbie discards such inputs and raises this warning. If you see
    this warning, you should add a restrictive precondition, such
    as <code>:pre (&lt; -100 x 100)</code>, to prevent large inputs.
  </p>

  <h3 id="native-ops">Native <var>operation</var> not supported on your system</h3>

  <p>
    Some systems do not have native implementations for all operations
    that Herbie uses. (For example, Microsoft's <code>math.h</code>
    does not provide the <code>y0</code> function.) Herbie provides a
    fallback implementation, but you can disable the fallback
    with <code>--disable precision:fallback</code>.
  </p>


  <h2>Known bugs</h2>

  <p>Some bugs cannot be directly fixed and are documented here.</p>

  <h3>Missing reports chart on Chrome</h3>

  <p>
    When using Chrome to view web pages on your local machine, Chrome
    disables certain APIs for security reasons; this prevents the
    Herbie reports from drawing the
    chart. <a href="http://www.chrome-allow-file-access-from-file.com/">Run
    Chrome with <code>--allow-file-access-from-files</code></a> to fix
    this error.
