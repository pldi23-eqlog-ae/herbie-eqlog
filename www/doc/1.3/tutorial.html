    <h1>Herbie Tutorial</h1>
  </header>

  <p>
    <a href="../../">Herbie</a> automatically rewrites
      floating point expressions to make them more accurate.
    Floating point arithmetic is inaccurate;
      hence the jokes that 0.1 + 0.2 ≠ 0.3 for a computer.
    But it is hard to understand and fix these inaccuracies,
      creating mysterious and hard-to-fix bugs.
    Herbie is a tool to help.
  </p>

  <p>
    To get started, <a href="installing.html">download and install</a>
    Herbie. With Herbie installed, you're ready to begin using it.
  </p>

  <h2>Giving Herbie expressions</h2>

  <p>Now that Herbie is installed, start it with:</p>

  <pre class="shell">herbie web</pre>

  <p>
    After a brief wait, this ought to open a web browser to a page
    with Herbie's results. The most important part of the page is this
    bit:
  </p>

  <figure>
    <img width="100%" src="web-input.png" />
    <figcaption>The program input field in the Herbie web UI.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Go ahead and type <kbd>(1 + x) - x</kbd> into this box and press
  enter. You should see the entry box gray out, then some additional
  text appear on the screen describing the various steps Herbie is
  doing. Eventually (after a few seconds) you'll be redirected to a
  page with Herbie's results. The most important part of that page is
  the large gray box in the middle:
  </p>

  <figure>
    <img width="100%" src="report-prog.png" />
    <figcaption>Input and output program from a Herbie report.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    This shows both the input <code>(1 + x) - x</code> that you gave
    Herbie, and also Herbie's idea of a more accurate way to evaluate
    that expression: <code>1</code>. Here, Herbie did a good job,
    which you can double check using the statistics above that box:
  </p>

  <figure>
    <img width="100%" src="report-large.png" />
    <figcaption>Statistics and error measures for this Herbie run.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    Here, Herbie reports that the improved the program has 0 bits of
    error, on average, whereas the original program had 29.4. That's
    because, when <code>x</code> is really big, <code>x + 1 = x</code>
    in floating-point arithmetic, so <code>(x + 1) - x = 0</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
    There's <a href="report.html">lots more information</a> on this
    results web page to help explain both what the accuracy is on
    different inputs and to describe how Herbie derived its result.
  </p>

  <h2>Programming with Herbie</h2>

  <p>Now that you've run Herbie and know how to read its results,
  let's work through applying Herbie to a realistic program.</p>

  <p>
    When you're working on a numerical program, it's best to keep
    Herbie open in a browser tab so you can run it easily. That way,
    when you're writing a complex floating-point expression, you can
    run Herbie to make sure you use the most accurate version of that
    expression that you can. Herbie
    has <a href="options.html">options</a> to log all the expressions
    you enter, so that you can refer to them later.
  </p>

  <p>However, if you're tracking down a bug that you think is caused
  by floating-point error, you'll need to identify the problematic
  floating-point expression before you can use Herbie on it.</p>

  <p>
    As an example, let's use <a href="http://mathjs.org">math.js</a>,
    an extensive math library for JavaScript, and walk
    through <a href="https://github.com/josdejong/mathjs/pull/208">bug
    208</a>, which found an inaccuracy in the implementation of complex
    square root. (For a full write-up of the bug itself, check out
    a <a href="https://pavpanchekha.com/blog/casio-mathjs.html">blog
    post</a> by one of the Herbie authors.)
  </p>

  <h2>Finding the problematic expression</h2>

  <p>
    Before using Herbie you need to know what floating-point
    expressions to feed it. In most programs, there's a small core
    that does the mathematical computations, while the rest of the
    program sets up parameters, handles control flow, visualizes or
    print results, and so on. The mathematical core is what Herbie
    will be interested in.
  </p>

  <p>
    For example, in the case of math.js, the mathematical core
    is in <a href="https://github.com/josdejong/mathjs/tree/master/lib/function"><code>lib/function/</code></a>.
    Each file in each subdirectory contains a collection of mathematical functions.
    The bug we're interested in is about complex square root, so let's look at the file
    <a href="https://github.com/josdejong/mathjs/blob/da306e26ed34272db44e35f07a3b015c0155d99a/lib/function/arithmetic/sqrt.js"><code>arithmetic/sqrt.js</code></a>,
    which contains real and complex square roots.
  </p>

  <p>
    The code handles argument checks, five different number types, and
    error handling. None of that is of interest to Herbie; we want to
    extract just the mathematical computation. So let's look at
    the <code>isComplex(x)</code> case:
  </p>

  <pre>var r = Math.sqrt(x.re * x.re + x.im * x.im);
if (x.im &gt;= 0) {
  return new Complex(
      0.5 * Math.sqrt(2.0 * (r + x.re)),
      0.5 * Math.sqrt(2.0 * (r - x.re))
  );
}
else {
  return new Complex(
      0.5 * Math.sqrt(2.0 * (r + x.re)),
      -0.5 * Math.sqrt(2.0 * (r - x.re))
  );
}</pre>

  <h2>Converting problematic code to Herbie input</h2>

  <p>
    This code contains a branch: one option for non-negative <code>x.im</code>,
    and one for positive <code>x.im</code>.
    While Herbie supports an <code>if</code> construct,
    it's usually better to send each branch to Herbie separately.
  </p>

  <p>
    Also, in this code, <code>x</code> is of
    type <code>Complex</code>, a data structure with multiple fields.
    Herbie only deals with floating-point numbers, not data
    structures, so we will treat the input <code>x</code> as two
    separate inputs to Herbie: <code>xre</code> and <code>xim</code>.
    We'll also pass each field of the output to Herbie separately.
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally, each field of the final output uses the
    variable <code>r</code>, which is defined in the first line of the
    code snippet. When you're using Herbie, you want to expand or
    inline intermediate variables like this, because the definition of
    that variable contains important information that Herbie can use
    to improve accuracy.</p>

  <p>Putting this all together, let's do the first field of the
  non-negative <code>x.im</code> case first. It looks like this:</p>

  <pre>0.5 * sqrt(2.0 * (sqrt(xre * xre + xim * xim) + xre))</pre>

  <p>Before running Herbie on this expression, click the “Additional
  options” link. You should see a box where you can enter a
  precondition; enter <kbd>xim &lt;= 0</kbd>. This makes sure that
  Herbie only considers the points this expression will actually be
  run on when improving the accuracy of this expression.</p>
  
  <h2>Using Herbie's results</h2>

  <p>Herbie will churn for a few seconds and produce an output,
  perhaps something like this:</p>

  <figure>
    <img width="100%" src="report-prog2.png" />
    <figcaption>Herbie's version of the complex square root expression.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Herbie's algorithm is randomized, so you likely won't see the
  exact same thing. For example, the branch expression <code>xre ≤
  6.68107529348e-308</code> will probably have some other really small
  number. And perhaps Herbie will choose slightly different
  expressions. But the result should be recognizably similar. In this
  case, Herbie reports that the initial expression had 38.7 bits of
  error, and that the output has 29.4.</p>

  <p>It's a little harder to describe what Herbie found wrong with the
  original expression, and why its new version is better—it is due to
  a floating-point phenomenon called “cancellation”. But you can get
  some insight from the error plot just below the program block:</p>

  <figure>
    <img width="100%" src="report-plot2.png" />
    <figcaption>Herbie's error plot for the complex square root expression.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>There's a lot going on here. Along the horizontal axis, you have
  the various input values (of <code>xim</code>). Note that the graph
  is log-scale, and includes only negative values (thanks to our
  precondition). So in the middle is the value -1, to the left you have
  values with large exponents approaching infinity, and to the right
  you have values with small exponents approaching 0.</p>

  <p>On the vertical axis, you have Herbie's error measure (bits of
  error), from 0 to 64. There are two lines drawn: a red one for your
  input expression and a blue one for Herbie's output. Lower is
  better. You can see from the plot that as <code>xim</code> gets
  larger (toward the right, closer to zero), Herbie's improvement
  becomes more and more important. Below the plot, there is a list of
  the argument names, with <code>xim</code> highlighted. If you switch
  it to <code>xre</code>, you will see that the two expressions are
  the same for positive <code>xre</code>, and that Herbie's output is
  better for negative <code>xre</code>. You can also see that the
  difference is quite large, with Herbie's output expression being
  much more accurate than its input.</p>

  <p>Note again that Herbie is randomized, and you may see somewhat
  different output than the screenshots and descriptions here. The
  overall gist should be similar, however.</p>

  <p>Now that you have the more accurate version of this expression,
    all you need to do is insert it back into the program:</p>

  <pre>var r = Math.sqrt(x.re * x.re + x.im * x.im);
// Herbie version of 0.5 * Math.sqrt(2.0 * (r + x.re))
var re;
if (x.re &lt;= 0) {
    re = Math.abs(x.im) * Math.sqrt(0.5) / Math.sqrt(r - x.re);
} else {
    re = 0.5 * Math.sqrt(2.0 * (r + x.re));
}
if (x.im &gt;= 0) {
  return new Complex(
      re,
      0.5 * Math.sqrt(2.0 * (r - x.re))
  );
}
else {
  return new Complex(
      0.5 * Math.sqrt(2.0 * (r + x.re)),
      -0.5 * Math.sqrt(2.0 * (r - x.re))
  );
}</pre>

  <p>Note that I've left the original code in place in a comment.
  That's because the original code is a bit more readable, and it also
  means that as Herbie gets better, we can re-run it to get future
  improvements in accuracy.</p>

  <p>By the way, for some languages, like C, you can use the drop-down
  in the top-right corner of the gray program block to see Herbie's
  output in that language. You'll probably need to clean up the
  resulting program a bit, though.</p>

  <h2>Next steps</h2>

  <p>With this change, we've made this part of the complex square root
  function much more accurate, and we could repeat the same steps for
  the other branches and other fields in this program. You now have a
  pretty good understanding of Herbie and how to use it.
