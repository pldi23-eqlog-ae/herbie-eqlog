    <h1>Command-line Options</h1>
  </header>

  <p>The <a href="../../"><code>herbie</code></a> command several
  subcommands and options that influence both its user interface and
  the quality of solutions that it finds.</p>

  <h2>Herbie commands</h2>

  <p>Herbie can be run both interactively and in batch mode, and can
  generate output intended either for
  the <a href="using-cli.html">command line</a>
  or <a href="using-web.html">the web</a>. We call these different
  ways of running Herbie different tools. Herbie provides four
  tools:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><code>herbie web</code></dt>
    <dd>Use Herbie through your browser. <code>herbie web</code>
    starts a web server for running Herbie on your local machine, and
    directs a browser to visit that server.</dd>

    <dt><code>herbie shell</code></dt>
    <dd>Starts a command-line interactive shell for using Herbie.
    Enter an <a href="input.html">FPCore expression</a> and Herbie
    will print its more-accurate version.</dd>

    <dt><code>herbie improve <var>input</var> <var>output</var></code></dt>
    <dd>Runs Herbie on the expressions in the file or
    directory <var>input</var>, and outputs the result
    to <var>output</var>, which will be a single file of FPCore
    outputs.</dd>

    <dt><code>herbie report <var>input</var> <var>output</var></code></dt>
    <dd>Runs Herbie on the expressions in the file or
    directory <var>input</var>, and produces a
    directory <var>output</var> of HTML pages that describe Herbie's
    output, how it derived that output, and additional charts and
    information about the improvement process. These pages can be
    viewed in any browser (though with a <a href="faq.html">quirk</a>
    for Chrome).</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>We recommend using the web tools, <code>web</code>
  and <code>report</code>, since HTML allows Herbie to give you more
  information about how and why it improved a floating-point
  expression's accuracy. Particularly useful are the graphs it
  produces of error versus input, which can help you understand
  whether Herbie's improvements matter for your user cases.</p>

  <p>For any tool, you can run <code>herbie <var>tool</var> --help</code>
    to see a listing of all available command-line options. This listing
    will include unsupported options not listed on this page.</p>

  <h2>General options</h2>

  <p>
    These options can be set on any tool. Pass them after the tool
    name but before other arguments, such as:
  </p>

  <pre class="shell">herbie improve --timeout 60 in.fpcore out.fpcore</pre>

  <p>Arguments cannot be put anywhere else.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><code>--seed S</code></dt>
    <dd>The random seed, which changes the randomly-selected points
      that Herbie evaluates candidate expressions on. The seed is a
      number between 0 and 2<sup>31</sup> (exclusive both ends). This
      option can be used to make Herbie's results reproducible or to
      compare two different runs. Prior versions of Herbie used a
      different format for seeds, which is now deprecated.</dd>

    <dt><code>--num-iters N</code></dt>
    <dd>The number of improvements Herbie attempts to make to the
      program. The default, 4, suffices for most programs and helps
      keep Herbie fast. If this is set very high, Herbie may run out
      of things to do and terminate before the given number of
      iterations, but in practice iterations beyond the first few
      rarely lead to lower error. This option can be increased to 5 or
      higher to check that there aren't further improvements that Herbie
      could seek out.</dd>

    <dt><code>--num-points N</code></dt>
    <dd>The number of randomly-selected points used to evaluate
      candidate expressions. The default, 256, gives good behavior for
      most programs. The more points sampled, the slower Herbie is.
      This option can be increased to 512 or 1024 if Herbie gives very
      inconsistent results between runs with different seeds.</dd>
    
    <dt><code>--timeout T</code></dt>
    <dd>The timeout to use per-input, in seconds. A fractional number
    of seconds can be given.</dd>

    <dt><code>--threads N</code> (for the <code>improve</code> and <code>report</code> tools)</dt>
    <dd>Enables multi-threaded operation. By default, no threads are
      used. A number can be passed to this option to use that many
      threads, or <code>yes</code> can be passed to tell Herbie to use
      all of the hardware threads.</dd>
  </dl>

  <h2>Web shell options</h2>
  
  <p>The <code>web</code> tool runs Herbie as a web server, and
  connects to it from your browser. It has additional options to
  control this server.</p>
  
  <dl>
    <dt><code>--port N</code></dt>
    <dd>The port to run the Herbie server on. The default port is 8000.</dd>

    <dt><code>--save-session dir</code></dt>
    <dd>Save all the reports for expressions enterred into the web
    shell to this directory. The directory is also used as a
    cache of already-computed expressions.</dd>

    <dt><code>--log file</code></dt>
    <dd>Write a web access log to this file. The file is formatted
    similarly to Apache logs. If Herbie crashes for some reason, this
    log will <emph>not</emph> contain a traceback.</dd>

    <dt><code>--quiet</code></dt>
    <dd>By default, but not when this option is set, a browser is
    started to point to the Herbie page. This option also shrinks the
    a banner printed to the command line.</dd>

    <dt><code>--public</code></dt>
    <dd>When set, users on other computers can connect to the demo and
    use it. (In other words, the server listens
    on <code>0.0.0.0</code>.). Also useful when Herbie is run
    through <a href="docker.html">Docker</a>.</dd>
  </dl>

  <h2>Rulesets</h2>

  <p>
    Herbie uses rewrite rules to make changes to formulas and improve
    their accuracy. These rules can be turned on and off in groups
    using <code>--disable rules:<var>group</var></code>
    and <code>--enable rules:<var>group</var></code>. In general,
    enabling rules improves the accuracy of Herbie's output but may
    allow it to use functions not available on your platform.
  </p>

  <p>The full list of rule groups is:</p>

  <table class="function-list">
    <thead><tr><th>Rule Group</th><th>Topic of rewrite rules</th></tr></thead>
    <tr><td>arithmetic</td><td>Basic arithmetic facts</td></tr>
    <tr><td>polynomials</td><td>Factoring and powers</td></tr>
    <tr><td>fractions</td><td>Fraction arithmetic</td></tr>
    <tr><td>exponents</td><td>Exponentiation identities</td></tr>
    <tr><td>trigonometry</td><td>Trigonometric identities</td></tr>
    <tr><td>hyperbolic</td><td>Hyperbolic trigonometric identities</td></tr>
    <tr><td>special</td><td>Special mathematical functions</td></tr>
    <tr><td>complex</td><td>Complex number arithmetic</td></tr>
    <tr><td>numerics</td><td>Special numerical functions <code>expm1</code>, <code>log1p</code>, <code>fma</code>, and <code>hypot</code></td></tr>
    <tr><td>bools</td><td>Boolean operator identities</td></tr>
    <tr><td>branches</td><td><code>if</code> statement simplification</td></tr>
  </table>

  <p>All groups except <code>numerics</code> are enabled by default.
  We recommend turning <code>numerics</code> on if these functions are
  available in your language, and disabling <code>complex</code>
  or <code>special</code> if those functions are poorly implemented in
  your language.</p>

  <h2>Search options</h2>

  <p>
    These options influence Herbie's search, most importantly the
    types of transformations that Herbie uses to find candidate
    programs. They offer fine-grained control and are only recommended
    for advanced uses of Herbie.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each option can be turned off with the <code>-o</code>
    or <code>--disable</code> command-line flag, and turned on with
    <code>+o</code> or <code>--enable</code>. The recommended options
    are the defaults; turning a default-on option off typically
    results in less-accurate results, while turning a default-off
    option on typically results in more-complex and more-surprising
    output expressions.
  </p>

  <dl>
    <dt><code>precision:double</code></dt>
    <dd>This option, on by default, tells Herbie default to
    double-precision calculations. If turned off, Herbie defaults to
    single-precision calculations. This option is a legacy option; use
    the <a href="input.rkt#precisions"><code>:precision</code> FPCore
    property</a> to change precisions instead.</dd>

    <dt><code>precision:fallback</code></dt>
    <dd>This option, on by default, tells Herbie to use fallback
    functions if a native implementation is not found for an operation
    (and print a warning). If turned off, operations with no native
    implementation will be disabled entirely. Turn this option off if
    you require Herbie to be faithful to your system's implementation
    of <code>libm</code>.</dd>

    <dt><code>setup:simplify</code></dt>
    <dd>This option, on by default, simplifies the expression before
    passing it to Herbie. If turned off, Herbie will not simplify
    input programs before improving them. Turn this option off if
    simplifying the input will create a lot of error, say if the
    association of operations is cleverly chosen.</dd>

    <dt><code>setup:early-exit</code></dt>
    <dd>This option, off by default, causes Herbie to exit without
    modifying the input program if it determines that the input
    program has less than 0.1 bits of error. Turn this option on if
    you are running Herbie on a large corpus of programs that you do
    not believe to be inaccurate.</dd>

    <dt><code>generate:rr</code></dt>
    <dd>This option, on by default, uses Herbie's recursive rewriting
    algorithm to generate candidate programs. If turned off, Herbie
    will use a non-recursive rewriting algorithm, which will
    substantially limit the candidates Herbie finds. You will rarely
    want to turn this option off.</dd>

    <dt><code>generate:taylor</code></dt>
    <dd>This option, on by default, uses series expansion to produce
    new candidates during the main improvement loop. If turned off,
    Herbie will not use series expansion. Turn this option off if you
    want to avoid series-expansion-based rewrites, such as if you need
    to preserve the equivalence of the input and output expressions as
    real-number formulas.</dd>

    <dt><code>generate:simplify</code></dt>
    <dd>This option, on by default, simplifies candidates during the
    main improvement loop. If turned off, candidates will not be
    simplified, which typically results in much less accurate
    expressions, since simplification is often necessary for
    cancelling terms. You will rarely want to turn this option
    off.</dd>

    <dt><code>reduce:regimes</code></dt>
    <dd>This option, on by default, uses Herbie's regime inference
    algorithm to branch between several program candidates. If turned
    off, branches will not be inferred and the output program will be
    straight-line code (if the input was). Turn this option off if
    your programming environment makes branches very expensive, such
    as in some cases of GPU programming.</dd>

    <dt><code>reduce:avg-error</code></dt>
    <dd>This option, on by default, causes Herbie to output the
    candidate with the best average error over the chosen inputs. If
    turned off, Herbie will choose the candidate with the least
    maximum error instead. This usually produces programs with worse
    overall accuracy. Turn this option off if worst-case accuracy is
    more important to you than overall accuracy.</dd>

    <dt><code>reduce:binary-search</code></dt>
    <dd>This option, on by default, uses binary search to refine the
    values used in inferred conditionals. This makes different runs of
    Herbie produce more similar results, and improves accuracy near
    those values. If turned off, binary search will not be used, and
    the branch values will be less accurately chosen. Turn this option
    off if behavior near branches is not important to you.</dd>

    <dt><code>reduce:branch-expressions</code></dt>
    <dd>This option, on by default, allows Herbie to branch on
      expressions, not just variables. This can improve accuracy on
      regime branching, slows Herbie down, particularly for large
      programs. If turned off, Herbie will only try to branch on
      variables. Turn this option off if Herbie runtime is more
      important to you than expression accuracy.</dd>
  </dl>

  <h2>Upgrading from Herbie 1.0</h2>

  <p>Herbie 1.0 used
  a <a href="../1.0/using-herbie.html">different</a> command line
  syntax, without multiple tools. Translate like so:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><code>herbie-1.0</code> → <code>herbie-1.3 shell</code></li>
    <li><code>herbie-1.0 file</code> → <code>herbie-1.3 improve file -</code></li>
    <li><code>herbie-1.0 files ...</code> → <code>cat files ... | herbie-1.3 improve - -</code><br/>
      Alternatively, collect the files into a directory and run <code>herbie-1.3 improve dir/ -</code></li>
  </ul>

  <p>The new syntax somewhat changes Herbie's behavior, such as by
  using the input expression as the output if Herbie times out. It
  also makes it easier to write Herbie's output to a file without
  using command-line redirection.</p>
