    <h1>Herbie 1.3 Release Notes</h1>
  </header>

  <p>
    The <a href="../..">Herbie</a> developers are excited to announce
    Herbie 1.3! This release focuses on <em>speed and
    transparency</em>: Herbie 1.3 is nearly twice as fast as
    Herbie 1.2, and includes cleaner, more comprehensive HTML output.
  </p>

  <p>
    Herbie automatically improves the accuracy of floating point
    expressions. This avoids the bugs, errors, and surprises that so
    often occur when working with floating point. Since
    our <a href="../../pldi15.html">PLDI'15 paper</a>, we've been hard at
    work making Herbie more versatile and easier to use.
  </p>

  <h2>Major features of this release</h2>

  <p><em>Speed:</em> Herbie is roughly twice as fast as in
  previous releases. Making this happen has involved changes large and
  small: a clever change to how we use simplification, a new sampling
  algorithm, and also lots of work tracking down especially slow
  expressions.</p>

  <p><em>Transparency:</em> Herbie's web output has become
  cleaner and more comprehensive. Herbie can now show you its output
  in C and TeX as well as mathematical notation. You can now specify
  preconditions and precisions when inputting expressions. And Herbie
  has a new "Metrics" tab to show in-depth internal information, which
  will help us continue to improve Herbie.</p>

  <h2>Beta features in this release</h2>

  <p><em>Windows support</em> has graduated from beta. We
  intend to support Windows going forward; if you run into any bugs,
  please <a href="https://github.com/uwplse/herbie/issues">let us
  know</a>.</p>

  <p><em>Plugins</em> can now
  <a href="plugins.html">define new number systems</a> and then teach
  Herbie to use them. There's a new plugin to add support
  for <a href="https://posithub.org/">posit arithmetic</a>. Right now
  the plugin system is still in flux, so if you'd like to use it,
  please <a href="https://mailman.cs.washington.edu/mailman/listinfo/herbie">write
  to us</a>.</p>

    <figcaption>Herbie 1.3 is roughly 2× faster than Herbie 1.2,
    thanks to efforts throughout the year. This plot shows how long
    Herbie's CI takes to run, for every passing CI run this release
    cycle. In April we added more tests, causing the bump in Travis
    time around then.</figcaption>

  <h2>Improvement to core algorithm</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Careful performance work has made Herbie nearly three times
      faster than the 1.2 release.</li>
    <li>Herbie now uses interval arithmetic to compute "ground truth"
      values. This makes Herbie's accuracy estimate for a
      program more correct.</li>
    <li>Support for single-precision mode has been significantly improved.</li>
    <li>Series expansion of <code>pow</code>s with constant exponents
      is now much faster.</li>
    <li>Complex numbers are now handled significantly more quickly.</li>
    <li>Various fixes have eliminated rare but large slowdowns.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Usability improvements</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Herbie's web interface now allows you to change preconditions
      and precisions (click “additional options” below the formula bar).</li>
    <li>You can now see C code for Herbie's output—use the drop-down
    above and to the right of the program box.</li>
    <li>Herbie has a <a href="../../index.html">new website</a>!
      Hopefully it's a little easier to learn about what Herbie is and
      how to use it.</li>
    <li>Herbie now shows preconditions in its HTML output.</li>
    <li>Herbie now produces somewhat simpler output, for example by
      simplifying exact constant expressions like <code>(+ 2
      2)</code>.</li>
    <li>You can now input if statements on the web using
      conditional-expression syntax.</li>
    <li>Herbie will now show warnings in its HTML output, including
      links to more documentation.</li>
    <li>Herbie now indents and breaks lines when it prints FPCores in
      the terminal.</li>
    <li>Herbie now uses <a href="https://katex.org/">KaTeX</a> to
      render math in the browser, which is significantly faster than
      the previous <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a>
      library.</li>
    <li>Error and timeout pages now show the input program.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Code Cleanup</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Reports now link to an extensive collection of quality and
      performance metrics. This should help improve Herbie's speed and
      accuracy over time.</li>
    <li>Documentation has been improved, with tables of content and
      explanations of preconditions and precisions.</li>
    <li>The new <kbd>reproduce</kbd> tool allows rerunning a
      report.</li>
    <li>The timebar on the metrics page now separates regime inference
      from binary search.</li>
    <li>Herbie's JavaScript code has been refactored, making it much
      easier to maintain.</li>
    <li>Lots of old, unused code has been deleted, including a lot of
      support code for the
      obsolete <a href="https://pavpanchekha.com/blog/herbie-viz.html">Herbie
      Visualizer</a>.</li>
    <li>Glue code has been moved into a single file, clarifying
      responsibilities for a lot of modules.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Try it out!</h2>

  <p>
    We're excited to continue to improve Herbie and make it more
    useful to scientists, engineers, and programmers around the world.
    We've got a lot of features we're excited to work on in the coming
    months. Please
