    <h1>Herbie 1.4 Release Notes</h1>
  </header>

  <p>
    The <a href="../..">Herbie</a> developers are excited to announce
    Herbie 1.4! This release continues a focus on speed and predictability.
  </p>

  <p>
    Herbie automatically improves the accuracy of floating point
    expressions. This avoids the bugs, errors, and surprises that so
    often occur when working with floating point. Since
    our <a href="../../pldi15.html">PLDI'15 paper</a>, we've been hard
    at work making Herbie more versatile and easier to use.
  </p>

  <h2>Major features of this release</h2>

  <p><em>Faster simplification:</em> Herbie now uses
    the <a href="https://github.com/mwillsey/egg">Egg</a> library to
    simplify expressions. Egg is roughly a hundred times faster than
    Herbie's existing simplifier; Herbie with Egg is roughly twice as
    fast overall. Egg is packaged for Windows, macOS, and Linux, so it
    should be transparently usable on all platforms.
  </p>

  <p><em>Input search:</em> Herbie now uses interval arithmetic to
  more efficiently sample valid inputs.
  The "<a href="faq.html#sample-valid-points">Cannot sample enough
  valid points</a>" error message should now be rarer,
    because Herbie should be much better at finding valid inputs,
    whereever they are.
  </p>

    <figcaption>Herbie 1.4 is substantially faster at simplifying
    expressions than Herbie 1.3 and 1.2. With timeouts off, these two
    releases have made simplification almost 4000Ã— faster. Figure

    submission</a>.</figcaption>

  <h2>Improvement to core algorithm</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Simplification now uses
    the <a href="https://github.com/mwillsey/egg">Egg</a> library;
    Herbie's existing e-graph library has been spun out as
    <a href="https://pkgs.racket-lang.org/package/regraph">regraph</a>,
    which can be used by other Racket projects.</li>

    <li>Herbie's input search pass now analyzes the input program and
    its precondition and avoids sampling invalid inputs as much as
    possible.</li>

    <li>The interval arithmetic library has gained support
    for <i>movability flags</i>, which allow Herbie to detect and skip
    unsamplable input points.</li>

    <li>The core program evaluator now operates in batch mode,
    speeding Herbie when it generates thousands of program
    candidates.</li>

    <li>The interval arithmetic library has been spun out as 
    <a href="https://pkgs.racket-lang.org/package/rival">rival</a>,
    which other Racket projects can now use. Minor bugs in the
    interval library have been fixed, and support has been extended to
    more functions.</li>

    <li>One form of exponential growth in the rewrite algorithm is
    fixed by a cache, eliminating a common cause of timeouts.</li>

    <li>Herbie's "final simplify" step no longer does constant
    folding, eliminating a rare source of accuracy regression.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Usability improvements</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Safari has been tested, and major bugs have been fixed.</li>

    <li>The documentation is now a bit clearer and more
    approachable.</li>

    <li>Herbie now blames the correct variable when a precondition is
    unsatisfiable.</li>

    <li>The <code>:spec</code> property and <code>let*</code>
    construct are now supported.</li>

    <li>Herbie now tries a little hard to produce simpler expressions.
    This change won't totally fix Herbie's weird output, but should
    help a bit.</li>

    <li>Herbie now aggregates profile information across a whole
    report and presents it in an interactive, JavaScript-enabled form
    on the "Metrics" page. This should help us keep speeding up
    Herbie.</li>

    <li>Some "internal" measures on the details page now show correct
    data.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Code Cleanup</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Several herbie dependencies have been spun out as libraries,
    including the C and TeX translators
    (<a href="https://pkgs.racket-lang.org/package/fpbench">fpbench</a>),
    the e-graph implementation
    (<a href="https://pkgs.racket-lang.org/package/regraph">regraph</a>),
    and the interval library
    (<a href="https://pkgs.racket-lang.org/package/rival">rival</a>).
    Other projects can now use these components.</li>

    <li>Herbie's support for complex number arithmetic has been
    extracted to a beta-quality
    <a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/complex-herbie">external
    library</a>. In the future we hope to provide a standard plugin
    API not only for complex numbers but also vectors, matrices, and
    other mathematical objects.</li>

    <li>Herbie's support for multi- and mixed-precision operations
    continues to improve, though there is more to do. We are targeting
    Herbie 1.5 for this to be "done".</li>

    <li>Many obsolete functions and data structures have been removed.
    A new random-number algorithm means pre-1.4 seeds will produce
    different results on Herbie 1.4.</li>

    <li>The code base was reorganized to split the web code across
    multiple files, with cleaner separation between
    responsibilities.</li>

    <li>Herbie now uses Github Actions, not Travis, as its continuous
    integration service. This already means that single-precision and
    posit support is better tested, and we hope to leverage Github
    Actions more in the future.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Try it out!</h2>

  <p>
    We're want Herbie to be more useful to scientists, engineers, and
    programmers around the world. We've got a lot of features we're
    excited to work on in the coming months. Please
