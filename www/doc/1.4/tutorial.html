  <p>
    <a href="../../">Herbie</a> rewrites floating point expressions to
      make them more accurate. Floating point arithmetic is
      inaccurate; even 0.1 + 0.2 ≠ 0.3 for a computer. Herbie helps
      find and fix these mysterious inaccuracies.
  </p>

  <p>
    To get started, <a href="installing.html">download and install</a>
    Herbie. You're then ready to begin using Herbie.
  </p>

  <h2>Giving Herbie expressions</h2>

  <p>Start Herbie with:</p>

  <pre class="shell">herbie web</pre>

  <p>
    After a brief wait, this will open your web browser and show you
    Herbie's main window. The most important part of the page is this
    bit:
  </p>

  <figure>
    <img width="100%" src="web-input.png" alt="The program input field in the Herbie web UI."/>
  </figure>

  <p>Type <kbd>(1 + x) - x</kbd> into this box and press enter. You
  should see the entry box gray out, then some text appear on the
  screen describing what Herbie is doing. After a few seconds, you'll
  be redirected to a page with Herbie's results. The most important
  part of that page is the large gray box in the middle:
  </p>

  <figure>
    <img width="100%" src="report-prog.png" alt="Input and output program from a Herbie report." />
  </figure>

  <p>
    It shows the input, <code>(1 + x) - x</code>, and Herbie's more
    accurate way to evaluate that expression: <code>1</code>. Herbie
    did a good job, which you can see from the statistics at the top
    of the page:
  </p>

  <figure>
    <img width="100%" src="report-large.png" alt="Statistics and error measures for this Herbie run." />
  </figure>

  <p>
    The initial program had 29.4 bits of error (on average), while
    Herbie's better version had 0 bits of error. That's because
    <code>(1 + x) - x</code> should always be exactly equal
    to <code>1</code>, but in floating-point arithmetic,
    when <code>x</code> is really big, <code>1 + x</code> rounds down
    to <code>x</code> and the expression returns <code>0</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
    There's <a href="report.html">lots more information</a> on this
    results web page, which you can use explain more about the
    expression's errors and how Herbie derived its result.
  </p>

  <h2>Programming with Herbie</h2>

  <p>Now that you've run Herbie and know how to read its results,
  let's apply Herbie to a realistic program.</p>

  <p>
    Herbie's input expressions can come from source code, mathematical
    models, or even a debugging tool
    like <a href="https://herbgrind.ucsd.edu">Herbgrind</a>. But most
    often, they come from your mind, while you're writing new
    mathematical code.
  </p>

  <p>When you're writing a new numerical program, it's best to keep
  Herbie open in a browser tab so you can run it easily. That way, you
  can run Herbie on any complex floating-point expression and so
  always use an accurate version of that expression. Herbie
  has <a href="options.html">options</a> to log all the expressions
  you enter, so that you can refer to them later.</p>

  <p>However, let's suppose you're instead tracking down a
  floating-point bug in existing code. You'll need start by
  identifying the problematic floating-point expression.</p>

  <p>To demonstrate the workflow, let's walk through
    <a href="https://github.com/josdejong/mathjs/pull/208">bug 208</a>
    in <a href="http://mathjs.org">math.js</a>, an extensive math
    library for JavaScript. The bug deals with an inaccuracy in the
    implementation of square roots for complex numbers. (For a full
    write-up of the bug itself, check out
    a <a href="https://pavpanchekha.com/blog/casio-mathjs.html">blog
    post</a> by one of the Herbie authors.)
  </p>

  <h2>Finding the problematic expression</h2>

  <p>
    In most programs, there's a small core that does the mathematical
    computations, while the rest of the program sets up parameters,
    handles control flow, visualizes or print results, and so on. The
    mathematical core is what Herbie will be interested in.
  </p>

  <p>
    For our example, let's start
    in <a href="https://github.com/josdejong/mathjs/tree/master/lib/function"><code>lib/function/</code></a>.
    This directory contains many subdirectories; each file in each
    subdirectory defines a collection of mathematical functions. The
    bug we're interested in is about complex square root, which is
    defined in
    <a href="https://github.com/josdejong/mathjs/blob/da306e26ed34272db44e35f07a3b015c0155d99a/lib/function/arithmetic/sqrt.js"><code>arithmetic/sqrt.js</code></a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    This file handles argument checks, five different number types,
    and error handling, for both real and complex square roots. None
    of that is of interest to Herbie; we want to extract just the
    mathematical core. So skip down to the <code>isComplex(x)</code>
    case:
  </p>

  <pre>var r = Math.sqrt(x.re * x.re + x.im * x.im);
if (x.im &gt;= 0) {
  return new Complex(
      0.5 * Math.sqrt(2.0 * (r + x.re)),
      0.5 * Math.sqrt(2.0 * (r - x.re))
  );
}
else {
  return new Complex(
      0.5 * Math.sqrt(2.0 * (r + x.re)),
      -0.5 * Math.sqrt(2.0 * (r - x.re))
  );
}</pre>

  <p>This is the mathematical core that we want to send to Herbie.</p>

  <h2>Converting problematic code to Herbie input</h2>

  <p>
    In this code, <code>x</code> is of type <code>Complex</code>, a
    data structure with multiple fields. Herbie only deals with
    floating-point numbers, not data structures, so we will treat the
    input <code>x</code> as two separate inputs to
    Herbie: <code>xre</code> and <code>xim</code>. We'll also pass
    each field of the output to Herbie separately.
  </p>

  <p>
    This code also branches between non-negative <code>x.im</code> and
    negative <code>x.im</code>. It's usually better to send each
    branch to Herbie separately. So in total this code turns into four
    Herbie inputs: two output fields, for each of two branches.
  </p>

  <p>Let's focus on first field of the output for the case of
  non-negative <code>x.im</code>.</p>

  <p>The variable <code>r</code> is an intermediate variable in this
  code block. Intermediate variables provide Herbie with crucial
  information that Herbie can use to improve accuracy, so you want to
  expand or inline them. The result looks like this:</p>

  <pre>0.5 * sqrt(2.0 * (sqrt(xre * xre + xim * xim) + xre))</pre>

  <p>Recall that this code is only run when <code>x.im</code> is
  non-negative. So, before running Herbie on this expression, click
  the “Additional options” link, and enter <kbd>xim &gt;= 0</kbd> for
  the precondition. This asks Herbie to consider only non-negative
  values of <code>xim</code> when improving the accuracy of this
  expression.</p>
  
  <h2>Using Herbie's results</h2>

  <p>Herbie will churn for a few seconds and produce an output,
  perhaps something like this:</p>

  <figure>
    <img width="100%" src="report-prog2.png" />
    <figcaption>Herbie's version of the complex square root expression.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Herbie's algorithm is randomized, so you likely won't see the
  exact same thing. For example, the branch expression <code>xre ≤
  -4.780438341784697e-111</code> will probably have some other really
  small number. And perhaps Herbie will choose slightly different
  expressions. But the result should be recognizably similar. In this
  case, Herbie reports that the initial expression had 38.7 bits of
  error, and that the output has 29.4.</p>

  <p>It's a little harder to describe what Herbie found wrong with the
  original expression, and why its new version is better—it is due to
  a floating-point phenomenon called “cancellation”. But you can get
  some insight from the error plot just below the program block.
  Select the <code>xim</code> variable just below the plot, and you
  will see something like this:</p>

  <figure>
    <img width="100%" src="report-plot2.png" />
    <figcaption>Herbie's error plot for the complex square root expression.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>There's a lot going on here. Along the horizontal axis, you have
  the various values of <code>xim</code>. Note that the graph is
  log-scale, and includes only non-negative values thanks to our
  precondition. The value 1 is in the middle; to the left are values
  with small exponents close to zero, and to the right you have values
  with large exponents approaching infinity.</p>

  <p>The vertical axis measures bits of error, from 0 to 64. Lower is
  better. There are two lines drawn: a red one for your input and a
  blue one for Herbie's output. You can see from the plot that
  as <code>xim</code> gets smaller (toward the left, closer to zero),
  Herbie's improvement becomes more and more significant. You can also
  see that for very large values of <code>xim</code>, the original
  program had maximal error (in fact, it overflows) but the replace
  program is often better.</p>

  <p>Of course, your exact output will differ a bit from the
  screenshots and descriptions here, because Herbie is randomized.</p>

  <p>Now that you have the more accurate version of this expression,
    all you need to do is insert it back into the program:</p>

  <pre>var r = Math.sqrt(x.re * x.re + x.im * x.im);
// Herbie version of 0.5 * Math.sqrt(2.0 * (r + x.re))
var re;
if (x.re &lt;= -4.780438341784697e-111) {
    re = Math.abs(x.im) * Math.sqrt(0.5) / Math.sqrt(r - x.re);
} else if (x.re &lt;= 1.857088496624289e-105) {
    re = 0.5 * Math.sqrt(2.0 * (x.re + x.im));
} else if (x.re &lt;= 117.16871373388169) {
    re = 0.5 * Math.sqrt(2.0 * (r + x.re));
} else if (x.re &lt;= 5.213930590364927e+88) {
    re = 0.5 * Math.sqrt(2.0 * (x.re + x.im));
} else {
    re = 0.5 * Math.sqrt(2.0 * (x.re + x.re));
}
if (x.im &gt;= 0) {
  return new Complex(
      re,
      0.5 * Math.sqrt(2.0 * (r - x.re))
  );
}
else {
  return new Complex(
      0.5 * Math.sqrt(2.0 * (r + x.re)),
      -0.5 * Math.sqrt(2.0 * (r - x.re))
  );
}</pre>

  <p>Note that I've left the original code in place in a comment. As
  Herbie gets better, you can re-run it on this original expression to
  see if it comes up with improvements in accuracy.</p>

  <p>By the way, for some languages, like C, you can use the drop-down
  in the top-right corner of the gray program block to translate
  Herbie's output to that language.</p>

  <h2>Next steps</h2>

  <p>With this change, we've made this part of the complex square root
  function much more accurate, and we could repeat the same steps for
  the other branches and other fields in this program. You now have a
  pretty good understanding of Herbie and how to use it.
